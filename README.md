# Chessland Attacks

Written in C

Recreated a chessboard utilizing data structures, considering the positions of rooks and the absence of other pieces on the board. Implemented an algorithm that determines how many and which rooks can attack each piece.

#Story
In a nearby land there is quite the border dispute between many royal families. Each one has a champion chess piece (a rook) on a large 2D grid. The royal families would like to know how much peril their rook currently faces. Rooks can only attack other pieces in their rank or file (row/column). Additionally, a rook can only attack another rook if there is no other piece(s) directly in between the two. Unfortunately, the board is so large it is hard to eyeball whether 2 rooks can attack each other. You offer to solve the rook threat question in exchange for some coins.
